It is a console-based game, so you cannot see an image of the cards. Each card is represented with an English word that describes the shading and one/two/three symbol (s). The number of symbols represents the number, and each symbol represents the shape and color.



It has two versions. One is a practice game, and the other one is a challenge game which has a time limit. In the practice game, you can play as many rounds as you want, but in the challenge game, you only have 2 minutes to find as many sets as you can.


At the beginning of the game, you can choose a practice game or a challenge game.

After you choose your game, you can start playing the game. When you cannot find a set from the displayed card, you can type R to reset the cards. When you want to quit the game, you can type Q to quit the game. When you find a set, it will display another 12 cards and the number of sets that you found on the console. When you find a wrong set, it will ask you to try again.
